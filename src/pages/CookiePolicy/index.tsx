      About this Policy
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-3">
      Our Privacy Policy explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your personal information. The Cookies policy (this document) policy explains the use of cookies in more detail, such as what cookies are and how they are used. However, to get a full picture of how we handle your privacy this policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy.

      What are cookies?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-3">
      Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device, such as your computer, mobile device or smartphone, when you visit our website or use our services. Cookies can be recognised by the website that downloaded them — or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
      We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies last beyond the current session and are used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to us and interact with our services. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by us when you return to one of our sites or visit a third-party site that uses our services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

      Do I need to accept cookies?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-3">
      No, you do not need to accept cookies. But please be advised that if you do not accept cookies our services might be difficult or impossible to use. 
      </p>

      You can adjust the settings in your browser so that you will be notified when you receive a cookie. Please refer to your browser documentation to check if cookies have been enabled on your computer or to request not to receive cookies. As cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website’s essential features, we recommend that you accept cookies. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any products or services on the website that may require you to log in.
